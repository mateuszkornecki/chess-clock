# Chess Clock ü¶ÑÔ∏è

Feel free to check out the final [result](https://mateuszkornecki.github.io/chess-clock).

## About the project

Because of the temporary lock-down during the COVID-19 pandemic, I started playing chess. Unfortunately we was not able to find any nice looking counter, so I decided to create my own one.

Here you can find the concept made in [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/zVBFNEoke9oWRG1fh0fZ9x/chess-clock?node-id=0%3A1). The final design is slightly different, but the main concept is still present.

For the best experience download and use the app as a PWA.

There are still some improvements that needs to be done, if you will find any bug feel free to report it on the [issue page](https://github.com/mateuszkornecki/chess-clock/issues)!

## Tech stack

- Angular 10
- Typescript
- Ngrx

I am considering creating native versions (iOS / Android) with the Ionic.
